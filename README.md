# Prandium

Prandium will parse recipes and generate pretty html pages that you can host, for example here in Github.

### How ?

1. You need a folder to store your recipes, for a quick setup you can use the [prandium template](https://github.com/LudeeD/prandium-template), or take a look at my deployment (its in portuguese) [comida da boa](https://ludeed.github.io/comidadaboa/)
2. You need the prandium executable, fetch from [github releases](https://github.com/LudeeD/prandium/releases) or [cargo](https://crates.io/crates/prandium) with ```cargo install prandium```, _if you used the template above you will find the executables already there ready to be used_
3. With this 2 pre-conditions ready you can just run the prandium inside the folder, and pretty HTML should be generated
4. Feel free to tweak config files and theme files to make it your own.
