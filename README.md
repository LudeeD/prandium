# Prandium

Prandium will parse recipes and generate pretty html pages that you can host, for example here in Github.

### How ?

1. You need the prandium executable, fetch from [github releases](https://github.com/LudeeD/prandium/releases) or cargo.
2. You need a folder to store your recipes, for a quick setup you can use the [prandium template](https://github.com/LudeeD/prandium-template)
3. With this 2 pre-conditions ready you can just run the prandium inside the folder, and pretty HTML should be generated
4. Feel free to tweak config files and theme files to make it your own.
